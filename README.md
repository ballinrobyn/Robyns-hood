# Robyns-hood
This is my personal landing page that I coded from scratch for my CA1 for my graduate full stack web development diploma.
I own a premium freepik account, hence also own the license to the image used.

I coded everything in plain vanilla javascript, html5 and css3.

For the second part of my project, I added some form functions and used some bootstrap frameworks.
